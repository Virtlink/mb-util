## Collections

- `ListView` - an ordered list
- `SetView` - a set
- `MapView` - an associative array
- `BagView` - a multiset

- `MutableCollection`
  - `get` - gets the next element that would be returned by a call to `remove()`
  - `add` - adds an element to the collection
    - `List` - adds at the back
    - `Stack` - adds to the front
    - `Queue` - adds to the back
    - `PriorityQueue` - adds somewhere
    - `Set` - adds anywhere
  - `remove` - removes an element from the collection (from the back of a list)
    - `List` - removes from the back
    - `Stack` - removes from the front
    - `Queue` - removes from the front
    - `Set` - removes anything
  - NOTE: there is no guarantee that `add(e)` `remove()` returns the same element `e`.
  
- `MutableList` : `MutableCollection`
  - `peek` - gets the next element that would be returned by a call to `pop()`
  - `push` - adds an element at the front of the list
  - `pop` - removes an element at the front of the list  

For a stack, use `push` and `pop`.
For a queue, use `add` and `pop`, or `push` and `remove`.


Here is a proposal for a `ListView` interface implementation:

[mb.util.collections](src/main/java/mb/util/collections)

High-level design goals:
- Performant: where possible, allocations are reduced or removed (e.g., `Iterator` allocations), and where possible, the code will exit early (e.g., a size test before comparing lists)
- It should be easy to implement `ListView` or `CollectionView`; therefore there are many useful default implementations in the interface
- Code should not have to access the actual implementations: all classes are package local, only `ListView<E>` and `CollectionView<E>` are externally visible
- Similarly, all interfaces provide `of()`, `from()` and `fromCopy()` static functions that can create new instances of the corresponding interface.
  The implementation is free to choose the actual implementation, and whether to return a new instance or an existing one.

Details:
- The methods `of()`, `from()` and `fromCopy()` create new instances from an array of elements, a list, or a copy of a list respectively. The distinction between from() and of() is allow the creation of a list of lists.
- The methods `of()`, `from()` and `fromCopy()` are statically defined on the interfaces `ListView` and `CollectionView`. This way, you can explicitly specify whether you want a `ListView` (using `ListView.of()`) or a `CollectionView` (using `CollectionView.of()`). If `ListView` and `CollectionView` where classes, then `ListView.of()` could not override `CollectionView.of()` and return a different type.
- Depending on the overload called, the `ListView` or `CollectionView` creates a different implementation.
- There is one implementation for empty lists, whose methods can quickly return that the list is empty. There is one instance of the empty list, which is returned for all empty lists.
- There is one implementation for singleton lists, whose methods are optimized for this use case.
- There is one implementation wrapping a list (and one wrapping a collection), delegating all operations to the underlying list or collection.
- There is one implementation wrapping an array. Without this, a `ListView` would wrap a list that wraps an array, and all delegating methods would have another layer of indirection.
- Lists return the same hashcode as the `AbstractList` of Java.
- Lists can be compared to any `Iterable`.
- The default implementations return themselves on a call to `asUnmodifiable()`, making this very cheap.


## Mutable Collections

[mb.util.collections.mutable](src/main/java/mb/util/collections/mutable)

The mutable collection interfaces implement the normal Java interfaces as well,
and actually guarantee that they can be mutated (therefore adhering to the interface specification).


## Immutable and Persistent Collections

[mb.util.collections.immutable](src/main/java/mb/util/collections/immutable)

The immutable collection interfaces guarantee that the collection never changes and that it's
thread-safe. The persistent collection interfaces allow the collection to be changed,
where each change returns a new persistent collection. They also provide a `builder()` method,
which returns a `Builder` object that implements the corresponding mutable collection interface.
